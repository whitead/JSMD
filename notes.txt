Multiple scenes
----

We need to have short scripts in the HTML that will define the
properties of the simulation. We could also work with custom
elements. Better to use scripts, since it's easy.

Next, we loop over the scripts.

Something like:

<div class="simulation">
     <script>
	var parent = document.scriptNode (?)	
	s = new Simulation(...)
	s.square_lattice(...)
	parent.simulation = s;

     </script>

</div>
